Plan of action:

The plan is to have a separate front-end and back-end(and possibly a database in some light form).

The front end will most likely be written in vanilla JS, and the back end possibly utilise Deno(as there's some earlier experience with the framework).

Requirements:
 - A login/user identification of some form
 - A main page with following features:
    - Possibility to add to shot counter
 - A statistics page with following features:
    - A view of the logged in user's history
    - Possibility to edit individual record's timestamp or remove individual record
    - An overview of all users stats (possibly it's own page)

Nice to haves:
 - Neat visuals
 - A more advanced login/user identification(e.g. utlizing Google's identification)
 - Sound effects
 - Animations on the main page
 - Possibility to view other individual users stats/records

MVP: 
1) Create a simple skeleton main page
2) Link to backend using REST API
3) Create a solution for database/storing records
4) Figure out where and how to host the webappi
5) Create the stats page(s)
6) Create a fully functional webapp

If there's time over, continue with the rest!
